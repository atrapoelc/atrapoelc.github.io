            <p class="intro">
                Originally, I graduated from English and Russian language at the Faculty of Education. I was always keen
                on learning languages. After seven years spent in HR, I have found out that actual work in this area
                does not meet up my expectations. As I was longing for being helpful for employees so as being effective
                in my job, I did realise that a proper system and technologies are essential. This mindset brought me to
                my first step to enter IT area â€“ I became a consultant of HR cloud system. During my parental leave,
                when covid has already been ruling the world, the idea of transitioning my career was even more
                supported. Thanks to Czechitas, I have taken the basic courses and discovered my enthusiasmus, which is
                definitely need if you want to do something well:). I could explore another world of different languages
                â€“ HTML and CSS, which helped me to connect my interest in languages so as in IT. Moreover, I have been
                continuously studying in CoreSkill programme, where I have been developing my advanced skills to become
                a front-end developer ðŸ˜Š.
